* XFCE4 Dark Amoled Theme

A dark XFCE/XFWM4 theme with an AMOLED-friendly black background and light-blue accents.

Most of the code was shamelessly stolen (forked) from
[[https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme][Gruvbox GTK Theme]] by Fausto-Korpsvart.
Colors are based on the [[https://github.com/ianyepan/tron-legacy-emacs-theme][tron-legacy]] Emacs theme by ianyepan.
